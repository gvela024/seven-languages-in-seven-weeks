1. Io example problems
https://gist.github.com/jezen/7972975

2. An Io community that will answer questions
Probably stack overflow, like everything else

3. A style guide with Io idioms
Couldn't find one immediately, decided not to spend too much time on it. Couldn't even find an auto formatter in atom for Io.
